  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a writer and historian, currently teaching in Harvard's History and Literature program. My main <a href="http://momoulton.com">portfolio page</a> (very much a work in progress!) has links to my writing and my other programming projects.</p>
  <h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
  <p>I'm interested in digital media and am taking this course to further my web skills. I'd like to be able to work as a freelance back-end web developer in the future.</p>
  <h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
  <p>I have a background in programming in Java. I took CSE10b (Introduction to Computer Science Using Java II) last semester and am currently enrolled in CSE22 (Data Structures). This summer I took a digital media course (Explorations in Screen-Based and Physical Computing) and learned a lot more JavaScript. I've picked up HTML and CSS through a variety of sources, mostly online and some short in-person classes at WCC and GDI in Boston. And I attended RailsBridge last spring, though it was a bit beyond me at that point. I've also studied digital mapping using ArcGIS.</p>
  <h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
  <p>Mac.</p>
  <h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
  <p>Nope. I'm excited to get building some web applications!</p>
